  <h1>The Murwa Family Heritage</h1>
  <p>
    The Murwa family traces its origins to Western Kenya, where our ancestors
    built a home based on faith, integrity, and unity. Over the years, our family
    has spread across regions but continues to share the same love and respect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each generation has contributed unique talents and achievements — from teachers
    to farmers, leaders to innovators — all carrying forward the Murwa name with pride.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our elders always remind us that family is not just blood — it is a bond
    of shared values and mutual support. This website keeps their memory alive.
